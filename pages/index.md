At the University of Maryland, College Park, I am:

* Designing and simulating 10,000 mÂ² photorealistic off-terrain environments in Isaac Sim for robust multi-robot navigation and swarm planning.
* Integrating custom-built Husky (AGR) robot with sensors and a Nav2-inspired stack in ROS 2 for visual SLAM and autonomous navigation.
* Creating testbeds for cobot training with reinforcement learning in IsaacLab, benchmarking policies for manipulation tasks.
* Simulating tendon-actuated finger joints and generating synthetic data with domain randomization for VLM-based manipulation research.

At STEER Tech, I am:
* Deploying V-SLAM with voxel vision on edge devices for real-time localization and 3D understanding.
* Ensembling depth and segmentation neural networks for risk-aware point cloud generation and 3D bounding box estimation. 

Previously at Kanan Park Technologies, I:
* Trained walking controllers for the bipedal Cassie robot in MuJoCo and fine-tuned reinforcement learning policies in robosuite via reward shaping.
* Prototyped a 3-DoF robotic arm for auto soldering, implementing sensor fusion with Extended Kalman Filters for improved control.
